# TDX (TeamDynamix) Improved

## :construction: Work in Progress

We use [TeamDynamix](https://www.teamdynamix.com) for issue tracking where I'm currently contracting.
I'm not the biggest fan of the software but have to spend a fair amount of time in it daily so I'll be
addressing some of the pain points I've hit using it here.

This repo will start with some userstyles to improve the appearance of TDX from it's incredibly bright,
all white, in your face, mostly default-Bootstrap styles to something I find more bearable.

**Please Note:** On the off chance anyone finds this repo, and has a use for it, please understand
this is very much a work in progress and I'm focusing on the "screens" I spend the most time looking
at first.

### :calendar: Future Plans

I intend to turn this into a browser extension which will inject the styles (removing the need for
Stylish, Stylus or any other 3rd party extensions) and will also use JS to add some additional
client-side functionality to TDX. This will all happen as I need and as I get to it, no timetable
for these enhancements currently.
